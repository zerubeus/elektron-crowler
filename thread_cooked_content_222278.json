The presets are showcasing the new features of DN2. Even the DN1 factory content did not try too hard to emulate classic FM sounds, and it is almost a cliché to make glassy or bell-like or metallic sounds with FM. DN1’s approach to simplicity with whole-number ratios (later softened with the addition of offsets) steers away from those. The presets lean towards uniqueness rather than emulation.</p>\n<p>There is an older video on approximating DX7 sounds with DN1.

Unfortunately, many of the soundpacks for DN1, free or otherwise, are only available in .syx format (including the free ones from Elektron?) and right now those cannot be loaded onto DN2. Elektron have promised this capability in a future update. The DX7-like sounds I mentioned above are in .dnsnd format, which can be loaded into DN2. I have some paid soundpacks for DN1 in this format that I could put onto DN2.</p>\n<p>So, bottom line is, you will have to be patient, but you could go searching in old DN1 demo videos to see if you can find the sort of sounds you are looking for, and if so, you at least know it’s possible, even if you can’t have it right away.</p>"

        "content": "<p>This was inspired by Tubesockor’s remake of the Last Ninja Wastelands tune.  (though not related)</p>\n<p>He mentioned using the LFOs to do some of the SID arp/trill sounds.  I didn’t look any further into this, and then figured I’d see what I could come up with.  I found a good method for three note arps.  <img src=\"https://www.elektronauts.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\">  It may or may not be what he did, but it was a fun experiment.  Works with any sound.</p>\n<p>I set the first LFO to a pulse wave (trigger type) at 33% duty cycle, and then moved the phase until the first 33% of the triggered note is unaffected.  The LFO rate needs to be set so that it covers the full triggered note (typically 16 note).  Then set the amount until it’s the semitone that you want for your SID-arp-chord.</p>\n<p>Do the same thing with LFO 2, only 33% duty cycle, and shift it over to 66% for phase.  Then set your next semitone up.</p>\n<p>You now have three semitones cycling slowly.</p>\n<p>Now you can adjust the LFO rates in relation to your tempo.  You may need to change the gate length to maintain continuity for the arp, and in my case I used four steps per “note” in the sequencer.  You could also use note repeats if you like.</p>\n<p>I then added a sweeping filter to sweep up as the trills/arps played to give it that overarching single-note sound like in a SID tune.  Add a touch of delay maybe.</p>\n<p>You can hear it in the tune I just posted in the Digitone II only tracks thread.</p>\n<p>There are probably lots of fun ways to achieve the same thing, but I wanted to try the LFOs.</p>"

Very interesting and if you have a lot of parameter locked trigs makes the euclidian sequence very cool and different though somewhat related to the original in a way, as you said.</p>\n<p>The inverse direction also works interestingly enough; if you are in euclidian mode and parameter lock the 10th PULSE wherever it is (like say on page 2 step 8, whatever), when you switch off euclidian and go back, that parameter lock will appear in the normal sequencer as a parameter locked trig on the 10th STEP!</p>\n<p>Very weird but kind of neat and fun!
